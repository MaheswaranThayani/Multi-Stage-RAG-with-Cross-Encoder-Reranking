# 📄 PDF Question Answering Bot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based PDF Question Answering application built using Python, LangChain, Streamlit, FAISS, and **local HuggingFace models**. This application allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions, with the system retrieving relevant chunks using embeddings and generating accurate answers **only from the uploaded PDF content**.

## Features

<<<<<<< HEAD

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Framework | Streamlit |
| LLM Framework | LangChain |
| Text Extraction | PyPDF2 |
| Text Splitting | LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter |
| Embeddings | HuggingFace Sentence Transformers |
| Vector Store | FAISS |
| Language Model | Local HuggingFace text2text model (`google/flan-t5-small` by default) |

##  Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- A machine that can download and run a small HuggingFace model (the first run will download `google/flan-t5-small`)

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd New_Tech_project
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Environment Variables

For the current local-only HuggingFace setup **no API keys are required**.
You can still use a `.env` file for future extensions, but it is not needed to run this version.

## 🎯 Usage

### Step 1: Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 2: Upload a PDF

1. Click on "Upload a PDF Document" or drag and drop a PDF file
2. Click the "🔄 Process PDF" button to extract and process the text
3. Wait for the processing to complete (you'll see page count and chunk count)

### Step 3: Ask Questions

1. Type your question in the chat input at the bottom
2. Press Enter or click send
3. View the answer and source documents

### Step 4: View Sources

- Click on "View Source Documents" to see the exact chunks from the PDF that were used to generate the answer
- This helps verify the accuracy and transparency of the responses

## Configuration Options

<<<<<<< HEAD
The app currently runs **entirely with local HuggingFace models**:

- Embeddings: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Generator: `google/flan-t5-small` (loaded via `transformers` pipeline)

If you want to switch to a different local model, change the model name passed to `load_local_hf_pipeline` in `app.py`.

## 🧠 How It Works
=======
### Using HuggingFace
1. The app uses HuggingFace's `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings
2. modify the code to use HuggingFace Hub models

## How It Works
>>>>>>> b872fe17bad3d3e09d451186a7a37fdff1e5a915

1. **PDF Upload**: User uploads a PDF document through Streamlit interface
2. **Text Extraction**: PyPDF2 extracts text from all pages of the PDF
3. **Text Chunking**: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter divides text into overlapping chunks (1000 chars with 200 char overlap)
4. **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk is converted to a vector using HuggingFace embeddings
5. **Vector Storage**: FAISS stores all chunk embeddings for efficient similarity search
6. **Question Processing**: User's question is embedded using the same embedding model
7. **Retrieval**: FAISS finds the top-k most similar chunks to the question
8. **Answer Generation**: A local HuggingFace pipeline receives the top chunks as context and generates an answer using **only that context**
9. **Response Display**: Answer and source documents are displayed to the user

## 📊 Features Breakdown

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **PDF Processing** | Extracts text from PDFs with page-by-page processing |
| **Smart Chunking** | 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap for context preservation |
| **Vector Search** | FAISS-based similarity search (retrieves top 3 chunks) |
| **Source Tracking** | Shows exact source chunks used for each answer |
| **Chat Interface** | Conversational UI with message history |
| **Error Handling** | Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages |

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Two-Column Layout**: Upload area and chat area side by side
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for PDF processing status
- **Chat History**: Persistent conversation during session
- **Source Expanders**: Collapsible sections for viewing sources
- **Clear Chat**: Button to reset conversation history

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys secure and private
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive files

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not found"
**Solution**: Ensure you've created a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key`

### Issue: "Could not extract text from PDF"
**Solution**: The PDF might be scanned (image-based). Consider using OCR tools to convert scanned PDFs to text.

### Issue: "FAISS installation error"
**Solution**: If on Apple Silicon, you might need `faiss-cpu` instead. For GPU support, use `faiss-gpu`.

### Issue: Slow processing
**Solution**: Large PDFs take time. For better performance, consider:
- Using GPU for embeddings (if available)
- Reducing chunk size
- Processing PDFs in batches

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for multiple PDF uploads
- [ ] Export chat history to PDF/text
- [ ] Support for other document formats (DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple LLM provider support (Anthropic, Cohere, etc.)
- [ ] Conversation memory across sessions
- [ ] Advanced retrieval strategies (reranking, hybrid search)
- [ ] PDF annotation and highlighting
- [ ] User authentication and document management
